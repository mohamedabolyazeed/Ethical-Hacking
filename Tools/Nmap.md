# üîç Nmap (Network Mapper): The Hacker's Swiss Army Knife

## What is Nmap?
Nmap stands as one of the most powerful tools in the cybersecurity arsenal. Think of it as your digital reconnaissance tool - capable of mapping entire networks and uncovering their secrets with surgical precision.

> *"There's no hacker who doesn't use Nmap"* - A truth in the security community

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Capabilities

### 1. Host Discovery
- Maps active devices across networks
- Identifies live hosts without triggering alerts
- Creates comprehensive network topology maps

### 2. Port Scanning
- Detects open ports with stealth
- Identifies closed or filtered services
- Reveals potential entry points

### 3. Service Detection
- Fingerprints running services
- Identifies software versions
- Discovers potential vulnerabilities

### 4. OS Detection
- Determines operating system versions
- Identifies system architecture
- Maps network infrastructure

### 5. Vulnerability Detection
- Integrates with vulnerability databases
- Identifies known security flaws
- Assists in penetration testing

### 6. NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)
- Automates complex scanning tasks
- Enables custom vulnerability checks
- Extends functionality through community scripts

## üöÄ Essential Scan Types

### Basic Scans
```bash
# Standard scan
nmap <target>

# Aggressive scan (combines multiple techniques)
nmap -A <target>

# Network range scan
nmap 192.168.1.1-254

# Specific port scan
nmap -p 80,443 <target>

# Script scanning
nmap --script <script_name> <target>
```

### Advanced Scanning Techniques

#### TCP SYN Scan
```bash
nmap -sS <ip>
```
*The ninja of port scans - stealthy "half-open" scanning*

#### TCP Connect Scan
```bash
nmap -sT <ip>
```
*The diplomat - completes full TCP handshakes*

#### TCP ACK Scan
```bash
nmap -sA <target>
```
*The detective - reveals filtered ports and firewall rules*

#### UDP Scan
```bash
nmap -sU <ip>
```
*The explorer - maps UDP services*

#### Decoy Scanning
```bash
nmap -D <decoy1>,<decoy2>,<real>,<decoy3> <target>
```
*The illusionist - masks your scan among decoys*

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Always get permission** before scanning networks
2. **Start with basic scans** before aggressive ones
3. **Document your findings** systematically
4. **Be mindful of network loads** during scans
5. **Use stealth when necessary** but understand the trade-offs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Nmap is powerful - use it responsibly
- Different scan types suit different scenarios
- Regular updates keep your Nmap installation current
- Combine techniques for comprehensive results
- Practice in controlled environments first
