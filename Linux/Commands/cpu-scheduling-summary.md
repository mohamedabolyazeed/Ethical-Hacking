## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Command History**
   - Use `Ctrl + R` to search command history
   - Use `!!` to repeat last command
   - Use `!$` to use last argument of previous command

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `Ctrl + A`: Move to beginning of line
   - `Ctrl + E`: Move to end of line
   - `Ctrl + U`: Clear line before cursor
   - `Ctrl + K`: Clear line after cursor

3. **File Operations**
   - Always use `-i` flag with `rm`, `mv`, and `cp` for interactive mode
   - Use `{}` for batch operations: `touch file{1..10}.txt`

4. **System Safety**
   - Always backup before major system changes
   - Use `sudo` with caution
   - Test commands that could be dangerous on test files first

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. Always verify commands before execution, especially when using `sudo`
2. Back up important data regularly
3. Be extra careful with `rm -rf` commands
4. Check system logs regularly for errors
5. Keep your system updated with latest security patches
